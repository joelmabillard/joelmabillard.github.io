I am a lecturer in the theory group of the laboratory Matière et Systèmes Complexes (MSC). My research is in non-equilibrium statistical physics and focuses on dissipative hydrodynamics and transport phenomena in statistical systems with broken symmetries, such as crystals. I use statistical mechanics approaches to identify phenomenological properties starting from the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics at the microscale. This analytical approach is complemented by numerical simulations of molecular dynamics. My other interests include chemically active systems, Markov-chain Monte-Carlo numerical simulations and the links between non-equilibrium statistical physics and the cosmology of the early universe.
