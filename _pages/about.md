Joël Mabillard
======

I am a lecturer in the theory group of the laboratory Matière et Systèmes Complexes. My research is in non-equilibrium statistical physics and focuses on dissipative hydrodynamics and transport phenomena in statistical systems with broken symmetries, such as crystals. I use statistical mechanics approaches to identify macroscopic non-equilibrium properties starting from the underlying Hamiltonian dynamics at the microscale. This analytical approach is complemented by numerical simulations of molecular dynamics. My other interests include chemically active systems, Markov-chain Monte-Carlo numerical simulations and the links between non-equilibrium statistical physics and the cosmology of the early universe.
